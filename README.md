# Assignment 5 - CSS Animations

## 📖 Overview
This project is part of my CSS learning journey.  
In this assignment, I mainly worked with **CSS Animations** to add motion and effects to elements.  
Along with animations, I also used some basic **CSS properties** for styling.

## ✨ Features
- Created animations using **@keyframes**  
- Applied animation properties like `duration`, `delay`, `iteration-count`, and `timing-function`  
- Combined animations with basic styling (color, margin, padding, etc.)  
- Simple and interactive design

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Download or clone the repository.  
2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser.  

## 📚 Learning Outcome
- Learned how to create **animations using @keyframes**

- Understood how to combine animations with normal CSS properties for better effects  
- Improved creative CSS design skills
